# Optimizing-Solar-Rooftop-Installations-in-Grenada
Exploring and optimizing solar rooftop installations in Grenada using advanced data analysis techniques.

**ABOUT THE PROPOSAL -**
Grenada, like many other countries, has been actively promoting solar rooftop installations as a key component of its renewable energy strategy. The Caribbean region, including Grenada, faces challenges related to energy security and high dependency on imported fossil fuels. These challenges have motivated governments in the region to focus on renewable energy sources, particularly solar energy, to diversify their energy mix and reduce their carbon footprint.

Grenada, being located in the Caribbean, enjoys abundant sunlight throughout the year. This makes it highly conducive for solar power generation. The country's geographical location allows for high solar insolation, making solar rooftop installations a viable and efficient energy solution. Solar rooftop installations in Grenada have been adopted both in residential and commercial sectors. Homeowners and businesses have been investing in solar panels to generate electricity for their own consumption, thereby reducing their reliance on the national grid.

The integration of building type, rooftop characteristics, and geographical location for optimizing solar installations in Grenada is a novel approach. Prior research in this specific context is limited, making this study unique and valuable for sustainable energy planning in the region. This research proposal outlines our intent to explore and optimize solar rooftop installations in Grenada using advanced data analysis techniques. The dataset provides a rich source of information to address the research questions and aims to contribute meaningful insights to the field of renewable energy planning.

**RESEARCH QUESTIONS -**
The aim of our project is to try and analyze the below-mentioned research objectives which can help Grenada plan its solar rooftops -
1. How can we optimize solar rooftop installations in Grenada to maximize energy generation while considering building types and rooftop characteristics?
2. What is the relationship between estimated tilt, building height, and energy generation potential?
3. Can we develop a predictive model to estimate yearly electricity generation based on building features and geographical location?

**ABOUT THE DATASET -**
This dataset contains solar rooftop potential data (suitable rooftop area, installable capacity, estimated yearly electricity generation, and building type ) at individual building structure levels for a sample area of interest in Grenada Island. The data was gathered by extracting building rooftop footprint polygons from very high-resolution satellite stereo imagery of 0.5m resolution. The rooftop angle, obstruction, and shading were considered during suitable area calculation. The results can be aggregated by different sectors or administrative units for further analysis, which is useful for planning and decision-making. The dataset contains the following columns:
• uuid: Unique identifier for each building structure
• City: City in Grenada where the building is located
• Surface_area: Total surface area of the building's rooftop
• Potential_installable_area: Suitable rooftop area for solar installation
• Peak_installable_capacity: Maximum capacity of solar installation possible on the rooftop
• Energy_potential_per_year: Estimated yearly electricity generation from the rooftop solar installation.
• Assumed_building_type: Type of building (e.g., residential, commercial, industrial)
• Estimated_tilt: Estimated tilt of the rooftop.
• Estimated_building_height: Estimated height of the building.
• Estimated_capacity_factor: Factor representing the efficiency of solar energy conversion.
• Unit_installation_price: Cost per unit installation
• Comment: Additional comments or notes
